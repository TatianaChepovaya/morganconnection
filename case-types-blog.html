              increased motion practice. While most firms bury premises
              liability within their personal injury practice, Morgan & Morgan
              has a dedicated premises liability group with over 100 attorneys
              who have the experience and expertise to go up against even the
              most merciless opposing counsel. Additionally, the vast majority
              of our attorneys were formerly on the defense side of the same
              field, allowing us to evaluate cases from both the plaintiff and
              defense perspectives.
