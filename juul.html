            Government officials had been aware of toxic water contamination at
            U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for decades.
            Despite their knowledge, those in power ignored the issue and then
            denied victims their right to seek justice. Between August 1953 and
            December 1987, service members, their families, and base employees
            at Camp Lejeune consumed and bathed in water that contained high
            levels of toxic chemicals.
